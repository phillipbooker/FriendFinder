# FriendFinder

Friend finder is a service that allows the user to find people with similar interests. Friend Finder uses a Node.js server built with Express.

The user fills out a survey composed of questions used to determine their compatibility with other users. Once the survey is submitted, Friend Finder finds the most compatible user by making a POST request to the server.
